# Nexpoline
 NexPro is an advanced system call interception framework designed to address modern security threats by offering enhanced control mechanisms. and Building protection upon the foundational work of nexpoline, NexPro introduces fine-grained policies, behavioural learning, process lineage verification, enhanced cryptographic signatures, modular architecture, and user-space control. These improvements enable more secure and efficient system call management, making NexPro a viable solution for preventing unauthorized system access and detecting anomalies in real-time. By adopting these new features, NexPro ensures greater 
flexibility, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic computing environments, including cloud and container-based systems.
