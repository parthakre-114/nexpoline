To build a mechanism for making system calls a privilege, not a right, for both Windows and Linux, you'll need to follow a comprehensive roadmap. This will involve deep learning about OS internals, security models, kernel development, and system call interception techniques. Here's a step-by-step guide

### 1. Foundation Learning
   - Operating System Concepts Start by studying the core concepts of operating systems, focusing on process management, system calls, memory management, and security models.
     - Recommended Books 
       - Operating Systems Three Easy Pieces by Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau
       - Modern Operating Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum
   - Windows and Linux Kernel Architecture Study how both kernels manage processes, threads, and system calls.
     - Linux Understand the monolithic architecture, system call table, and system call implementation.
     - Windows Explore NT kernel architecture, Win32 API, and kernel-mode operations.

### 2. System Call Interception Techniques
   - Linux
     - ptrace Learn about the `ptrace` system call used for process debugging and how it can be used to intercept system calls.
     - seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) Study seccomp for limiting system call capabilities within a process.
     - LD_PRELOAD Explore how dynamic library injection can be used to intercept system calls at the user level.
     - eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) Learn about eBPF for kernel-level program execution, which can be useful for system call filtering.
   - Windows
     - Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) Study how WFP can be used to intercept network-related system calls.
     - System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT) Hooking Learn SSDT hooking for system call interception at the kernel level.
     - Windows Detours Study Microsoft Detours for function interception and system call monitoring.

### 3. Kernel Programming
   - Linux Kernel Development Learn how to develop Linux kernel modules, which is essential for modifying system call behavior.
     - Books Linux Kernel Development by Robert Love.
   - Windows Kernel Development Study Windows kernel drivers and kernel-mode programming.
     - Learn about Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and developing kernel-mode drivers to hook or filter system calls.
   
   Tools to learn
   - Linux Build simple Linux kernel modules, modify the system call table, and explore kernel hooks.
   - Windows Learn how to develop and deploy Windows kernel drivers using the WDK.

### 4. Sandboxing Techniques
   - Linux
     - Namespaces Learn how Linux namespaces can create isolated environments.
     - cgroups Study control groups (cgroups) for resource isolation and system call restrictions.
     - seccomp-bpf Deep dive into using seccomp-bpf for sandboxing and limiting system calls.
   - Windows
     - Windows Sandbox and Containers Study how Windows Sandbox and Hyper-V containers work for isolating processes.
     - AppContainer Learn about AppContainer and other Windows sandboxing techniques for limiting system capabilities.

### 5. Privilege Management
   - Linux
     - Capabilities Learn about Linux capabilities, which allow fine-grained control over privileges.
     - Polkit and SELinux Study security-enhanced frameworks like SELinux for privilege management.
   - Windows
     - User Access Control (UAC) Study how UAC works for managing privileges.
     - Token-Based Access Control Explore token-based privilege mechanisms used by Windows for managing system calls.

### 6. Advanced Security Concepts
   - Mandatory Access Control (MAC) Understand how systems like SELinux, AppArmor (Linux), and Windows Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) enforce security policies.
   - Application Whitelisting and Blacklisting Study techniques for controlling which applications are allowed to make system calls.
   - Memory Protection Techniques Learn about memory protection techniques like DEP, ASLR, and Control Flow Guard (CFG) on Windows to prevent exploitation of system calls.

### 7. Developing the Mechanism
   - Design the Architecture
     - Policy Framework Define a policy framework for specifying which system calls each process is allowed to use.
     - Interception Layer Implement an interception layer to monitor and restrict system calls based on privileges.
   - Implementing System Call Filtering
     - Linux Use `seccomp-bpf`, eBPF, and namespaces to restrict and monitor system calls.
     - Windows Implement system call filtering using SSDT hooking or Windows filtering techniques.
   - Policy Management GUI Create a user-friendly management interface to configure policies, view logs, and update system call privileges.

### 8. Testing and Debugging
   - Debugging Kernel Modules and Drivers
     - Linux Learn to use tools like `gdb`, `ftrace`, `systemtap`, and `dmesg` for kernel debugging.
     - Windows Use WinDbg, Driver Verifier, and Event Viewer for debugging Windows drivers.
   - Stress Testing and Security Auditing Test the robustness of your system call restriction mechanism against common attack vectors (e.g., privilege escalation, DoS attacks, code injection).

### 9. Integration with Existing Security Frameworks
   - Linux Integrate your system with existing security frameworks like SELinux, AppArmor, or systemd for broader security coverage.
   - Windows Consider integrating with existing security features like Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

### 10. Documentation and Community Contribution
   - Documentation Maintain thorough documentation of your implementation, including setup instructions, policy definitions, and usage guidelines.
   - Open Source Contribution Consider contributing your solution to the open-source community or creating a repository for others to collaborate and improve the solution.
